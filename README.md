# ODEm (Optimal Design Experiments with Matlab)
ODEm (Optimal Design Experiments with Matlab) is a program developed using Matlab for the computation
of optimal design experiments. The program includes heuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization
(PSO), simulating annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), exact methods such as interior point method (IP),
active set method (AS), sequential quadratic programming (SQP), Nelder Mead (NM) and also hybridizations of
both exact and heuristic methods.

## Using the Windows installer
You cand find the installer inside the [Windows Installer folder](Windows%20Installer/). This tool will install ODEm as an aplication in your computer. If it is the first time you install the application, the MATLAB Runtime library is going to be downloaded from the Internet and installed (about 500 MB). This can take several minutes depending on the quality of the connection. 

### Prerequisites
```
A Windows Operating System.
```

## Using Matlab Source Code in any Operating System
The program can also be used in any other Operating System apart from Windows. You need to open the source files of
the program located in [Matlab Source Code folder](Matlab%20Source%20Code/) and run the form_main.m file.

### Prerequisites
```
Matlab version 2016 or higher
The following Matlab products:
 - 'Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox' version 11.0 or higher
 - 'Global Optimization Toolbox' version 3.4.1 or higher
```

### Known Issues
 - If you run the program in an Operating System different from Windows the 'Save Results' option may not work.


## Documentation
We recommend reading the program manual before using the software. The manual can be found in [Manual.pdf](Manual.pdf)

Also you can find the code documentation in Documentation folder. One interesting part of the Documentation is the function call tree of the program, which can be found in [Documentation/ODEm/graph.png](Documentation/ODEm/graph.png)
